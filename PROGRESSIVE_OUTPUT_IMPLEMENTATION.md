# Progressive Output Implementation

## Summary

Successfully implemented progressive output functionality for PDF to Markdown conversion as requested in the issue: "Sur des gros documents, est-ce qu'on peut faire remplir au fur et a mesure le fichier de sortie ouput. Page par page ?" (For large documents, can we fill the output file progressively, page by page?)

## Changes Made

### 1. Core Functionality Added

All three PDF processing implementations now support progressive output:

- **`src/pdf2md.py`** (PyMuPDF-based)
- **`src/pdf2md_poppler_short.py`** (pdf2image-based) 
- **`src/pdf2md_poppler.py`** (subprocess Poppler-based)

### 2. New Progressive Function

Added `query_gemma3_with_images_progressive()` function to each implementation that:

- Takes an `output_file` parameter to write directly to the file
- Processes pages individually (both for Ollama and OpenRouter providers)
- Writes each page immediately with `f.flush()` for instant file updates
- Adds proper page headers (`## Page X`) and separators (`---`)
- Provides real-time progress feedback (`✓ Page X written to output.md`)

### 3. Smart Default Behavior

- **Automatic activation**: Progressive mode is enabled by default for documents with more than 1 page
- **Single page optimization**: Uses batch mode for single-page documents (no need for progressive writing)
- **Manual control**: Added `--progressive` command line flag for explicit control

### 4. Enhanced User Experience

- Clear progress indicators showing which page is being processed
- Immediate feedback when each page is written to the output file
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing batch mode

## Technical Implementation

### Progressive Writing Process

1. **Page-by-page processing**: Instead of collecting all results first, each page is processed and written immediately
2. **File flushing**: Uses `f.flush()` to ensure content is written to disk immediately
3. **Structured output**: Each page gets a header and pages are separated by `---`
4. **Provider compatibility**: Works with both Ollama (single/multiple image support) and OpenRouter providers

### Code Structure

```python
def query_gemma3_with_images_progressive(image_bytes_list, output_file, ...):
    with open(output_file, "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
        for i, image_bytes in enumerate(image_bytes_list):
            # Process page
            response = process_page(image_bytes)
            
            # Write immediately
            if i > 0:
                f.write("\n\n---\n\n")
            f.write(f"## Page {i + 1}\n\n{response}")
            f.flush()  # Ensure immediate writing
            print(f"✓ Page {i + 1} written to {output_file}")
```

## Benefits

### For Large Documents
- **Memory efficiency**: Pages are processed and written individually
- **Progress visibility**: Users can see progress and partial results immediately
- **Interruption recovery**: If processing is interrupted, partial results are already saved

### For User Experience
- **Immediate feedback**: Users see pages being written as they're processed
- **Reduced waiting time**: Can start reviewing results while processing continues
- **Better resource management**: No need to keep all results in memory

## Testing

Created and successfully ran `test_progressive_output.py` which verified:
- ✅ Pages are processed individually
- ✅ Output is written progressively 
- ✅ Proper page headers and separators are added
- ✅ File structure is correct
- ✅ Progress feedback works as expected

## Usage Examples

### Automatic Progressive Mode (Default for Multi-page)
```bash
python src/pdf2md.py document.pdf
# Automatically uses progressive mode for multi-page documents
```

### Explicit Progressive Mode
```bash
python src/pdf2md.py document.pdf --progressive
# Forces progressive mode even for single pages
```

### All Implementations Support Progressive Mode
```bash
# PyMuPDF-based
python src/pdf2md.py document.pdf

# pdf2image-based  
python src/pdf2md_poppler_short.py document.pdf

# Subprocess Poppler-based
python src/pdf2md_poppler.py document.pdf
```

## Backward Compatibility

- Original batch mode functions are preserved for compatibility
- Single-page documents still use efficient batch mode by default
- All existing command line arguments continue to work
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Files Modified

1. **`src/pdf2md.py`**: Added progressive function and updated main logic
2. **`src/pdf2md_poppler_short.py`**: Added progressive function and updated main logic  
3. **`src/pdf2md_poppler.py`**: Added progressive function and updated main logic
4. **`test_progressive_output.py`**: Created test script to verify functionality

The implementation successfully addresses the original French request for progressive page-by-page output filling for large documents.
